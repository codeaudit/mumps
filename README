                        MUMPS Version 1.60

  This version of mumps runs on all FreeBSD Versions 3 through 9, many linux
  versions, OSX 10.4 through 10.8 in 32 bit mode and Solaris.  This version
  is also available for windows (tested on XP and Windows 7).
  
  NOTE: The compiler version has changed with version 1.59 of MUMPS and all
               routines will have to be recompiled. To do this, use:
	     M> M ^$R(“%RECOMP”)=^$R(“%RECOMP”)
	     then D ^%RECOMP in each UCI.

  To use, download mumps-1.60.tar.gz from 	
		https://sourceforge.net/projects/mumps/files/
 and un-tar.

  To get your executable, copy mumps.osvariant to mumps except for
  windows where mumps.exe is used as distributed.

  For windows, install the Cygwin environment at http://cygwin.com/setup.exe
  then setup the Cygserver using /usr/bin/cygserver-config.

  To use, first create a database, eg:
	./mumps -v TEST -b 16 -s 1000 testdb

  then, start the environment, eg:
	./mumps -j2 testdb

  then, load the unitities, eg:
	./mumps -x 'O 1:("utils":"R") U 1 R X X X' testdb

  The environment is then started using:
	./mumps testdb
  or
	./mumps -x "D ^%M" testdb

  Remember to shut it down when you are done to free the shared memory.
  Do either M> K ^$J or MCL> D ^SSD
